# 🍳 Recipes API

A simple REST API for managing recipes, built with **Node.js** and **Express**.  
This is an **ongoing project** — new features and improvements are added every week.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Node.js** + **Express**
- **UUID** for unique recipe IDs
- **Morgan** for request logging
- **express-rate-limit** for request throttling
- **Custom Middlewares** for error handling and validation
- **JSON data store** (using `recipes.json` instead of a database at this stage)

## 📂 Project Structure

```
controllers/
└── recipesController.js # Core API logic
data/
└── recipes.json # Current data storage (JSON file)
middlewares/
├── errorHandler.js # Global error handler
├── rateLimiter.js # Request limiting per IP
└── validators.js # Input validation
routes/
└── recipes.js # API route definitions
utils/
└── dataStore.js # Read/write utilities for JSON storage
package.json
package-lock.json
server.js # Main server entry point

```

---

## Installation & Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start

The server runs by default on:
👉http://localhost:3000

```

## ✨ Current Features:

- CRUD for recipes: create, read, update, delete
- Filtering by difficulty, max cooking time, search query, and minimum rating
- Sorting by date, rating, or cooking time
- Update recipe rating through a dedicated endpoint
- Basic statistics endpoint (recipe count, average cooking time, most common ingredients)
- Rate limiting (20 requests per minute per IP)
- Logging with Morgan using the dev format

## 🧭 Planned Features:

- More validation rules (via validators.js)
- Authentication and user management
- Switch from JSON file to a real database
- Unit tests and integration tests
- Advanced search and pagination

## 📌 API Endpoints (Overview):

- GET /api/recipes — fetch all recipes (with filtering/sorting options)
- GET /api/recipes/:id — fetch a single recipe by ID
- POST /api/recipes — create a new recipe
- PATCH /api/recipes/:id — update an existing recipe
- PATCH /api/recipes/:id/rating — update recipe rating only
- DELETE /api/recipes/:id — remove a recipe
- GET /api/recipes/stats — fetch general recipe statistics

## Notes

- This project is still under development — expect frequent updates.
- For testing, Postman collections are recommended.
- No database is used yet — all data is stored in recipes.json.
